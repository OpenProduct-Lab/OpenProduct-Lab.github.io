# 🧭 OpenProduct-Lab

**OpenProduct-Lab** is a community founded by [Leo Fernekes](https://www.youtube.com/@LeosBagOfTricks)  
dedicated to developing *open, human-centered hardware* through transparent collaboration.

## 🎯 Mission

We’re rethinking how technology is designed —  
focusing on **real human needs**, **elegant design**, and **sustainable manufacturing**.

> “Fight back against product *enshitification* by joining the community.”

Our goals are to:

1. Build a vibrant design community that shares knowledge freely.  
2. Develop open products that are purposeful, repairable, and long-lived.  
3. Empower independent creators with design resources, not walled gardens.  
4. Celebrate great design that balances function, form, and responsibility.

## 🧠 What We Do

### 1️⃣ Open Hardware Design
We prototype and document products in an open forum —  
via videos, GitHub repos, and Discord design sessions.  
All designs are **fully open-source**, from schematic to enclosure.

### 2️⃣ Community-Driven Development
Our members propose ideas, help refine specs,  
and share test data to improve each product iteration.

### 3️⃣ Educational Content
Electronics tutorials and breakdowns on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LeosBagOfTricks)  
teach the skills that make this ecosystem thrive.
