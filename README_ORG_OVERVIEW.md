# OpenProduct-Lab — Collaborative Product Lab

**Purpose:** Build a design-led, open hardware community where human factors, industrial design, and solid engineering meet.

This org houses:
- **Community-Product-Lab** — the collaboration handbook, patterns, and templates.
- **Product-01_CapacitiveSwitchTriggerModule** — our Pattern Project #1.
- **Shared-Libraries** — reusable firmware snippets, KiCad footprints, and mechanical parts.
- **Project-Template** — a ready-to-copy skeleton for new projects.

## How We Work (The Pattern)
1. **Intent** → real needs, constraints, and context.
2. **Specification** → measurable requirements (design + engineering).
3. **Prototype** → electronics, firmware, mechanical form.
4. **Test & Reflect** → data, observations, usability notes.
5. **Refine & Release** → tag a version; document thoroughly.

## Where to Talk
- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/<your_invite_code> *(replace this with your invite)*
- **GitHub Discussions**: in `Community-Product-Lab`

## Values
- Human-centered design, sustainability, longevity.
- Transparency of process (share reasoning, not just results).
- Respect across disciplines; designers and engineers are peers.
